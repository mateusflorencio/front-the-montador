# Project FrontEnd TheMontador

## Objetivo

The aim of the project was to create a page with simple html and css.
Then apply the best practices to the project and use BEM. <br>

Apply concepts by block, element and modifiers. <br>

When I started the project, it grew a lot, but later it was very easy because it was possible to reuse its lines. <br>
